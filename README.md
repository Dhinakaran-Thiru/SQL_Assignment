Question 1:
 Create a database named ecommerce.
 Create four tables under the ecommerce database: gold_member_users, users, sales, and product.
 Insert the provided values into their respective tables with appropriate data types.
 Display all the tables existing in the ecommerce database.
 Count all the records in each of the four tables using a single query.
 Calculate the total amount spent by each customer in the ecommerce company.
 Find the distinct dates each customer visited the website, displaying the date and customer name.
 Determine the first product purchased by each customer using information from the users, sales, and product tables.
 Identify the most purchased item by each customer and the number of times the customer has purchased it, showing item count and customer name.
 Find customers who are not gold members.

 Question 2:
 Create a table named product_details with the provided data structure.
 Write a query to determine, for each date, the number of different products sold and their names.
Output: The query results should include columns for the sell date (sell_date), number of products sold (num_sold), and a list of products sold on that date (product_list).

Question 3:
 The SQL script begins by creating a table named dept_tbl using the CREATE TABLE statement. This table has three columns: id_deptname, emp_name, and salary, as specified in the requirements. The id_deptname column likely combines both the department ID and the department name, but this might be an oversight in the provided data format.
Data Insertion: After creating the table structure, the script inserts the provided data into the dept_tbl table. Each row of the data corresponds to an employee's information, including the department they belong to (id_deptname), their name (emp_name), and their salary (salary).
Output Format: The SQL query then calculates the total salary of each department. However, it's important to note that the provided dataset does not include a clear department name or department ID field. The id_deptname appears to be a combination of the department ID and name, which would need to be parsed to obtain meaningful department names for calculation.
Total Salary Calculation: The SQL query likely utilizes the GROUP BY clause to group the data by department (after parsing the id_deptname), and the SUM() function to calculate the total salary for each department based on the aggregated salary values.
Output: Finally, the SQL query outputs the result in the specified format with two columns: dept_name and total_salary, showing the calculated total salary for each department.

Question 4:
 The SQL script starts by creating a table named email_signup with columns id, email_id, and signup_date, using the CREATE TABLE statement. This table will store the provided data related to email accounts and their signup dates.
 After creating the table structure, the script inserts the provided data into the email_signup table. Each row represents an email account along with its signup date.
 Before proceeding with the query, the script likely replaces any null values in the signup_date column with a default value of '1970-01-01'. This ensures consistency in the data and prevents errors in subsequent calculations.
The SQL query is then executed to find Gmail accounts specifically. It selects the count of Gmail accounts (count_gmail_account), the latest signup date (latest_signup_date), and the first signup date (first_signup_date) for Gmail accounts.
Difference Calculation: The query also calculates the difference in days (diff_in_days) between the latest and first signup dates for Gmail accounts, using appropriate date functions like DATEDIFF().
Grouping and Filtering: The query likely employs grouping and filtering mechanisms to isolate Gmail accounts from the dataset and perform calculations specifically for them.
Output Format: Finally, the query outputs the result in the specified format, showing the count of Gmail accounts, their latest signup date, first signup date, and the difference in days between them.
 In the output, count_gmail_account indicates the total number of Gmail accounts found in the dataset. latest_signup_date displays the most recent signup date among these accounts, while first_signup_date shows the earliest signup date. diff_in_days provides the calculated difference in days between the latest and first signup dates for Gmail accounts.
 The output helps analyze the signup trends of Gmail accounts, revealing insights such as the frequency of signups, the duration between the first and latest signups, and the growth rate of Gmail users over time.
 The SQL script efficiently handles data manipulation, null value replacement, and query execution to derive meaningful insights about Gmail account signups from the provided dataset.

 Question 5:
 Create Table: The script creates a table named sales_data with columns product_id, sale_date, and quantity_sold.
Insert Sample Data: Inserts sample data provided into the sales_data table, including product IDs, sale dates, and quantities sold.
Assign Rank: Using window functions, the script assigns ranks by partition based on product ID and identifies the latest product ID sold.
Compare Previous Quantity Sold: Retrieves the quantity_sold value from the previous row using window functions and compares it with the current row's quantity_sold.
Retrieve First and Last Values: Partitions the data based on product ID and returns the first and last values in the ordered set using window functions.
